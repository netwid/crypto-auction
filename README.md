# Crypto auction

## Made by team Levaki

### Abstract

In light of previous events, it is obvious that one **cannot trust** his money and personal data to cloud storages and big tech companies. In the world, where even payment services are hugely unreliable, what other service could hope to give insurance and warranties to his users?

### Solution

**We propose new form of conducting auctions, with the power of web3 and new decentralized techonologies.**
For mvp and proof-of-concept, we chose **open english auction**, as the most classic variant.
During 2 days of coding, we implemented dApp with back-end as *Solidity smart contract* and front-end as *React + taildwind*
